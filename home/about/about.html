                        Welcome to my world of technology and learning. Here, you’ll find a detailed look into who I am
                        and what drives my passion for programming, Linux, game development, and networking. I’m Axar, a
                        self-taught explorer always eager to dive deeper into the vast ocean of knowledge the internet
                        offers. Through curiosity and persistence, I’ve built my skills step by step, and I’m excited to
                        share my journey and insights with you.

                <p>I am a self-taught programmer who has always loved computers and technology. My interest started when
                    I was a child. I used to wonder how a computer could store information, follow commands, show
                    pictures, and run programs. I wanted to know how it all worked, from the way data is saved in memory
                    to how software and hardware talk to each other.</p>

                <p>I studied in school until the 12th grade, but I could not go to college because of money problems. I
                    worked in a shop to earn a living, but my interest in computers never went away. For many years I
                    did not have my own computer, but I kept learning from the internet, reading articles, and
                    collecting knowledge from different places online.</p>

                <p>After many years I finally got my own PC. That was when my real journey in programming began. I
                    started learning about programming languages, how computers are built, and how software is made. I
                    used free learning materials like tutorials, PDF books, documentation, and open source projects.</p>

                <p>C++ became my favorite language. It is fast and close to the hardware, and it also lets me create
                    clear and well-structured programs. Through C++ I learned about memory, data structures, algorithms,
                    and how programs talk to the hardware inside the computer.</p>

                <p>I do not just write code. I also try to understand how things work inside the computer. I learn how a
                    compiler changes code into instructions for the machine, how data is stored, how the operating
                    system controls processes, and how graphics are shown on the screen. Knowing why something works is
                    as important to me as knowing how to do it.</p>

                <p>The internet has been my greatest teacher. It is like a library for everyone in the world. I respect
                    it for giving free knowledge to anyone who wants to learn. As an author, I try to explain things in
                    a simple and clear way so that others who learn on their own can follow without confusion.</p>

                <p>I keep learning every day because technology is always changing. My journey has taught me that you do
                    not need a degree to be skilled in programming. What you need is passion, patience, and the will to
                    keep learning. For me, programming is not just a job or a skill. It is my dream and my lifelong
                    passion.</p>
