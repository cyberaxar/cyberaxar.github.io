                    In my daily work as an independent author and developer, I use Zorin OS® as my primary Linux
                    operating system for its stability, performance, and clean design. I rely on Visual Studio Code® as
                    my main coding editor for writing, testing, and organizing programming projects. For compiling my
                    C++ programs, I use the GNU Compiler Collection (g++), a widely respected and standards-compliant
                    compiler maintained by the Free Software Foundation. All of my book manuscripts, documentation, and
                    drafts are written and formatted using LibreOffice®, an open-source office suite that offers
                    flexibility and reliability.
